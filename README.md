# pay-select-component


I built this because I wanted a clean, modern way to handle payment method selection. It looks like a professional billing dashboard but keeps things simple with just HTML, CSS, and JS.

What it does:
Smart Selection: Even though they are checkboxes, I wrote a script so you can only pick one at a time (like a radio button).

Dark Mode: Styled with a deep navy/gray palette that looks great on modern apps.

Fully Custom: I hid the ugly default browser checkboxes and built custom "cards" that highlight when you click them.

Submit Logic: It checks if you actually picked something before letting you "submit."

How to customize:
If you want to change the blue color to something else, just look at the top of the CSS file and change the --primary variable.

Tech used:
HTML5

CSS (Flexbox & Variables)

Vanilla JavaScript (No bulky libraries)

Would you like me to help you with the actual command to push this to GitHub from your terminal?
